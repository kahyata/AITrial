Today is 28th August 2024.
I think the lesson today was to have first thought of were I would get the data to teach this model and grow it. The data collection part was all done
but were to get the data was the problem. Writing the code to do so was the easy part but now the question how can I write a program that will learn from the collected data if their
is not data in the first place. 
In the end, i gained on lesson in my self study of AI modelling. I will take this to heart. data first!
